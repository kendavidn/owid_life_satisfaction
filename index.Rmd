knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

# Load packages 
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")

# {.tabset}

## ðŸ”¢ Table

```{r}
# Your code here. You need to create a table with the following columns: Country, 2011, 2022, Absolute change, and Relative change. 
# Use the filter function to select only the years 2011 and 2022. 
# Use the pivot_wider function to create the columns for 2011 and 2022.
# Use the mutate function to calculate the Absolute change and Relative change.
# Use the reactable function to create the table.
```

## ðŸŒŽ Map

```{r}
# This code is already done for you. You don't need to change anything here. 
# But if you change any of the column names, or something else with the data,
# you may need to adjust the code below.
cantril %>% 
  mutate(`Cantril ladder score` = round(`Cantril ladder score`, 2)) %>%
  plot_geo(width = 940) %>% 
  add_trace(
    z = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
    color = ~`Cantril ladder score`,
    locations = ~Code,
    text = ~Country,
    frame = ~Year, colors = "YlGn"
  ) %>% 
  colorbar(title = NULL)
```


## ðŸ“ˆ Chart

```{r}
# Your code here. You need to create a line chart with the following features:
# Select a few countries (e.g., Norway, Australia, Germany, Bolivia, Colombia, Bhutan).
# Use ggplot to create the line chart.
# Use geom_line to create the lines.
# Use scale_y_continuous to set the y-axis limits.
# Use labs to set the axis labels.
# Use theme_minimal to set the theme.
# Finally, use ggplotly to convert the ggplot chart to a plotly chart.
```

## Advanced (Optional) ðŸ“ˆ

```{r}
# This code is optional. You can try to replicate the advanced chart from the example, but it's not required.
# If you want to try, start by consulting the documentation below
# This is pretty hard though, so don't worry if you can't get it to work.
